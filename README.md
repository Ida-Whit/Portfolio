## Portfolio Project

## Description
This project had me creating my portfolio that I will be able to use later on to showcase work I have done to future employers. I included 3 sections including About Me, Completed Works, and Contact Me. For now, only one item falls under completed works, but I plan to add more projects to that as the bootcamp progresses.
