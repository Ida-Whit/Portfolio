                    <p class="info-boxes">Hello! My name is Ida Whitcomb. I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in environmental science. 
                    I then worked at a job that did 24 hour environmental emergency cleanup services for about 4 years. I have since realized that is not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life, so I am searching for a new career. 
                    Web development caught my eye as a potential and I found that I really enjoyed it. The problem solving and the designing aspects of it really excite me.
                    In my free time, I enjoy reading books and knitting/crocheting. My most recent knitting project was a pair of cozy sock created with some yarn I bought on a recent trip to Nova Scotia. 
                    I also enjoy going for hikes with my fiance in the White Mountains, we are beginning our journey to complete all 4,000 footers.</p>

                    <p class="info-boxes">Horiseon Refactor project. I was given code for the Horiseon website to look at. I went through and refactored the code so that it would be a bit easier to read through.</p>
